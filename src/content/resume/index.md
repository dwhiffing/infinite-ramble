# Daniel Whiffing
## Developer/Designer
---
  I am proficient with ES6 (JavaScript), Ruby, Lua, and AS3. I also have experience with Java, and PHP.

  I've used Node.js when working with ES6 for the past 2 years, and have worked on many Rails applications.  I am well versed with current web front-end technologies, including React, React-Native and Angular, as well as Redux, Backbone, jQuery, and SCSS.

  I like to use a simple setup for my node projects, making use of Babel and simple npm scripts for recurring builds and ES6 support.  I use mocha/sinon/chai for testing, and have been playing around with [Wallaby](http://wallabyjs.com/) for constant coverage reporting within my editor.

  I've done game development for the web for many years, and have made games with AS2, AS3, JavaScript, Lua, and Java. More recently, I've been developing game prototypes using Phaser, focusing on simple, action based game mechanics. I've created prototypes for a variety of web game meetups and competitions, including Global Game Jam (3 years), TO Jam (2 years), JS13k (2 years), and Ludum Dare (1 year).  

  I've been trained as an artist, and I am experienced as a painter.

  I've also received training as a Graphic and Web Designer.

  I consider improving UX my primary goal while developing.

  I am passionate about making games that start simple but become complex over time.

  Some of my favorite games right now are [Hoplite](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.magmafortress.hoplite&hl=en), [Desert Golfing](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.captaingames.golf), and [Factorio](https://www.factorio.com/)
