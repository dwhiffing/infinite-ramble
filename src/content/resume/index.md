## Skills
---
  I am proficient with ES6 (Javascript), Ruby, Lua, and AS3. I also have experience with Java, and PHP.

  I've used Node.js when working with ES6 for the past 2 years, and have also worked on Rails applications.

  I am well versed with current web front-end technologies, including React and Angular, as well as Redux, Backbone, and Alt.

  I've done game development for the web for many years, and have made games with AS2, AS3, JavaScript, Lua, and Java.

  More recently, I've been developing game prototypes using Phaser, focusing on simple, action based game mechanics.  I'm starting to use a more TDD based approach to this development.

  I've been trained as an artist, and am very experienced as a painter. I've also been trained as a designer, and try to consider UX as much as possible while developing.

  I am passionate about making games that start simple but become complex over time.
