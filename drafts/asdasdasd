Generalized anxiety

I can often be impetuous which seems oxymoronic

It isnt because anxiety causes you to focus in on minor concerns and makes it difficult to focus

can also cause hand shakes

anxiety attacks

circular thinking

so while you are busy with all that you are usually ignoring what you are doing in the present, which is what causes the impetuous behavior.

In essence you are trying to do thing with care but in the end create a self full filling prophecy

If you take time to relax before you attempt to do something, you can prevent yourself from becoming anxious and screwing up something obvious.
