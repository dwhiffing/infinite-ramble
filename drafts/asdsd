release schedule

In order to release games as soon as possible after a news event occurs, we need to 
make sure that it is possible to produce a game in under a week.  This will be easier
if we strip out as much as possible for the initial release and add extra content a week
later.  This will make it easier to stick to deadlines, and force us to have a better
idea of the design of the game ahead of time.
