At starbucks today, a young man and his brother were discussing whether or not people read anymore.

They didn't quite specify what they meant specifically by "reading", until they asked the barista if she read.

She was confused, but responded, 'yes, anything by robert patterson'

The man, without a beat, claimed she was lying.  There's no way she reads. No one reads.

I interjected, "you guys read on the internet, don't you?"

The man responds, 'Yeah, but that's my twitter feed.'


Their ignorance brings up an interesting thought.  So many young people exclusively read about social media (their own/others lives) or some other kind of information that is consumed for the purposes of entertainment.

Since this young man reads exclusively on the internet, he finds it hard to believe that anyone would spend time reading a paperback book.  But the paper is irrelevant, reading fiction on a e-reader, tablet, or laptop fills the same purpose.

The experience of reading a novel via paperback book vs a e-reader/tablet is largely the same.

What the young man is really talking about, whether he knows it or not, is that in his circle, no one reads novels.

Instead, they read twitter/facebook feeds, top 10 lists, scroll through image feeds or blog posts.etc

This is comparable between watchers of reality tv vs. narrative based/scripted tv.
