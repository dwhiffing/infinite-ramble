      Epizeuxis - and yet, 
    hundreds of new melodies, new tunes, new harmonies are being composed upon hundreds of different keyboards every day in Dorset alone. 
    Our language, tiger, our language: 
      Analogy - keyboard - language
    hundreds of thousands of available words, frillions of legitimate new ideas, 
    so that I can say the following sentence and be utterly sure that nobody has ever said it before in the history of human communication: 
    Hold the newsreaders nose squarely, waiter, or friendly milk will countermand my trousers. 
    Perfectly ordinary words, but never before put in that precise order.

      Epanalepsis - ordinary order
    A unique child delivered of a unique mother."
  # "L: [to screen] ..."
    "F: And yet, oh, and yet, we, all of us, spend all our days saying to each other the same things time after weary time: 
      Epizeuxis - and yet
    I love you, Dont go in there, Get out, You have no right to say that, Stop it, Why should I, That hurt, Help, Marjorie is dead.
    Hmm? Surely, its a thought to take out for cream tea on a rainy Sunday afternoon."
  # "L: So, to you, language is more than just a means of communication?"

      Metaphor
    as you pluck from a old bookshelf a half-forgotten book of erotic memoirs. 
    Language is the creak on a stair,
      Metaphor 
    it's a spluttering match held to a frosted pane,
      Metaphor 
    it's a half-remembered childhood birthday party, 
      Metaphor
    it's the warm, wet, trusting touch of a leaking nappy,
      Metaphor 
    the hulk of a charred Panzer,
      Metaphor 
    the underside of a granite boulder,
      Metaphor
