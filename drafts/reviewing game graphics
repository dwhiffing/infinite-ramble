reviewing game graphics

in recent years, people have begun to rate a games graphics based on how realistic they are

this makes sense if the game was attempting a realistic style, and failed, creating visually unpleasing graphics that certainly warrant poor reviews

but games need not be realistic to be visually pleasing.  Playing asteroids on a vetor display gives a sensation that is not present in any other game, and makes it a unique experience that would certainly warrant a 10/10

Are the graphics effective at communicating the current game state? If you look at any single frame of the game, will a player be able to understand what is happening, what has just happened, and what will happen next?

How do the graphics move your eye? Do they steer your eye toward important game elements? Is the ui distracting or innefficient in displaying important information?  Is it difficult to read at a quick glance?

In the game super hexagon, i find the inclusion of ui very distracting, and i feel there should be an option to disable it during gameplay to increase the amount of emmersion, especially when that immersion is necessary to progress

None the less, this is a fantastic if relentless game.  It forces you to try again and again until you succeed, and it never holds your hand.
